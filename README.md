# 🤶 🎄 Advent of Code 2023 🎄 🤶

Ho ho ho! It's time for another round of advent of code 😊

---

### Techniques used 🎁

- TypeScript

---

### Structure 📄

- Inside the `src` folder, there is one folder for each day, marked with the
  number of the day, `01`, `02`, `03` etc. Each folder contains all the code
  needed to solve that days challenge.

---

### Get Started

- Inside a folder, run `npx ts-node index.ts` to run the main file for that day.
